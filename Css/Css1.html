    <h1>AMD</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <hr>

    <p class="para">Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., commonly abbreviated as AMD, is an American multinational
        semiconductor company
        based in Santa Clara, California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and
        consumer markets.</p>

    <p class="para">The company was founded in 1969 by Jerry Sanders and a group of other technology professionals.
        AMD's
        early
        products were primarily memory chips and other components for computers. The company later expanded into the
        microprocessor market, competing with Intel, its main rival in the industry. In the early 2000s, AMD experienced
        significant growth and success, thanks in part to its strong position in the PC market and the success of its
        Athlon and Opteron processors. However, the company faced challenges in the late 2000s and early 2010s, as it
        struggled to keep up with Intel in the race to produce faster and more powerful processors. In the late 2010s,
        AMD regained some of its market share thanks to the success of its Ryzen processors which are now widely
        regarded as superior to Intel products in business applications including cloud applications. AMD's processors
        are used in a wide range of computing devices, including personal computers, servers, laptops, and gaming
        consoles. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, a
        practice known as going fabless, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009.</p>

    <p class="para"> AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors, graphics
        processors, and
        FPGAs for servers, workstations, personal computers, and embedded system applications. The company has also
        expanded into new markets, such as the data center and gaming markets, and has announced plans to enter the
        high-performance computing market.[citation needed].</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>

    <p class="para">Advanced Micro Devices was formally incorporated by Jerry Sanders, along with seven of his
        colleagues from
        Fairchild Semiconductor, on May 1, 1969.[2][3] Sanders, an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing
        at Fairchild, had, like many Fairchild executives, grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support,
        opportunity, and flexibility within the company. He later decided to leave to start his own semiconductor
        company,[4] following the footsteps of Robert Noyce (developer of the first silicon integrated circuit at
        Fairchild in 1959)[5] and Gordon Moore, who together founded the semiconductor company Intel in July 1968.[6].

    <h2>Technology exchange agreement with Intel</h2>
    <hr>

    <p class="para">Intel had introduced the first x86 microprocessors in 1978.[50] In 1981, IBM created its PC, and
        wanted Intel's
        x86 processors, but only under the condition that Intel also provide a second-source manufacturer for its
        patented x86 microprocessors.[11] Intel and AMD entered into a 10-year technology exchange agreement, first
        signed in October 1981[45][51] and formally executed in February 1982.[34] The terms of the agreement were that
        each company could acquire the right to become a second-source manufacturer of semiconductor products developed
        by the other; that is, each party could "earn" the right to manufacture and sell a product developed by the
        other, if agreed to, by exchanging the manufacturing rights to a product of equivalent technical complexity. The
        technical information and licenses needed to make and sell a part would be exchanged for a royalty to the
        developing company.[33] The 1982 agreement also extended the 1976 AMDâ€“Intel cross-licensing agreement through
        1995.[33][34] The agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements, and after five years the
        right of either party to end the agreement with one year's notice.[33] The main result of the 1982 agreement was
        that AMD became a second-source manufacturer of Intel's x86 microprocessors and related chips, and Intel
        provided AMD with database tapes for its 8086, 80186, and 80286 chips.[34] However, in the event of a bankruptcy
        or takeover of AMD, the cross-licensing agreement would be effectively canceled.[52]</p>
